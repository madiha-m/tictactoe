### Implementation Plan: TicTacToe Game (Python)

This file outlines the step-by-step logic to implement the game in a clean, modular way using Python.

---

#### ðŸŽ¯ Goal

Build a command-line Tic Tac Toe game in Python, where a human plays against a basic computer (random move generator).  
In the future, this will be extended with AI.

---

#### ðŸ”§ Function Breakdown

##### 1. `tic_tac_toe()`
- Main function to start the game loop.
- Calls all helper functions.
- Controls turns and game progress.

##### 2. `create_board()`
- Initializes and returns an empty board.
- Can use a list of 9 elements: `[" "] * 9`.

##### 3. `get_empty_positions(board)`
- Returns a list of indexes on the board that are still empty.
- Helps validate moves and computer's random move logic.

##### 4. `make_move(board, player)`
- Places `X` or `O` on the board at a chosen valid position.
- Human: uses input.
- Computer: chooses randomly from available spots.

##### 5. `evaluate(board)`
- Checks the current board state to determine:
  - If a player has won (three same symbols in a row)
  - If the game is a tie (board full, no winner)

#### ðŸ”„ Game Flow Summary

1. Create an empty board

2. While the game is not over:
    a. Human makes a move
    b. Check for win or tie
    c. Computer makes a move
    d. Check for win or tie

3. Announce the result (win or tie)

#### ðŸ›  Future Additions

- AI logic (e.g., Minimax algorithm)
- GUI version using web version using React/Python backend
- Multiplayer mode (online or local)
